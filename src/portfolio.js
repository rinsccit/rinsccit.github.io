      'WaitWell is a patient visit tracker designed for hospitals and clinics under Nova Scotia Health in Halifax. It reduces patient anxiety by providing clear and real-time visibility into their visit progress - without exposing any personal health or medical information. The web application addresses a common patient experience gap: people often spend long periods waiting without clear communication about what is happening next. In busy clinical settings, this lack of visibility can increase stress for patients and families & create repeated status inquiries for staff and reduce overall confidence in the care process. It solves this by providing a simple and understandable timeline of visit progress from arrival to completion.',
    contribution: 'I contributed to this project as a maintainer and developer collaborating with team members on the project\'s development to ensure code quality.',
    outcome: 'The project is currently in development and has not been deployed yet but it has the potential to improve patient experience and operational efficiency in healthcare settings.',
